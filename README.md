## ✨ Project Overview

**Social Media Application** is a production-style, cross-platform social networking platform
designed to mirror real-world social media systems with a focus on **clean architecture,
modern UI, and scalability**.

The application enables users to **connect, share content, interact through likes and comments,
and manage personalized profiles**, all within a smooth and visually refined experience.

This project is built not as a demo, but as a **real, extensible product**, showcasing practical
skills in application design, backend integration, and long-term maintainability.

## 🎯 What Makes This Project Stand Out

- ✅ Real-world social media features (not just UI)
- ✅ Clean and modular code architecture
- ✅ Scalable backend integration
- ✅ Smooth UI interactions & animations
- ✅ Designed with future expansion in mind
